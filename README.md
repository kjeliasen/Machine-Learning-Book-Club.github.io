# Kevin's Machine Learning Book Club Repo

In the inaugural meeting, the majority of participants voted in favor of working through [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra - Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares (VMLS)](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/). The poll results were 7 for VMLS, with 5 voting for Hands-On Machine Learning.

The VMLS book is completely free on [vmls-book.stanford.edu](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/). The website also features a Python language companion along with additional slides, exercises, and resources.

We will meet every week and the meetings will have alternating purposes:
- Time for exercise collaboration, time to read sections, or share exercise solutions
- Discussion, overview, and connection of the chapter topics to the rest of our craft and to machine learning, in general.

In this way, we anticipate working through a chapter every two weeks, and we can adjust, if needed.

Machine learning methods and topics in this book include, but are not limited to:
- Feature engineering
- classification
- clustering
- image deblurring, convolution, etc...
